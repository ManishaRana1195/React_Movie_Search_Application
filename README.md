### Movie Search and Results UI
In this application, I have worked on 4 functionality, developing a movie search bar, making a http call using axios to fetch data from OMDB API(http://www.omdbapi.com/), creating component for show the search results and finally showing the movie details and rating information once the user clicks on a movie card.
